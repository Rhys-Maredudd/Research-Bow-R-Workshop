# Research-Bow-R-Workshop

## R you Ready for R?  

### PGR workshop for using programming in Research. 

R you curious about programming? R you interested in building your researcher toolbox with highly transferable skills? R you looking for free coffee, tea and sandwiches?!   

Look no further! Research Bow is hosting a full day programming workshop for the PGRâ€™s of sHiSS. The workshop will provide an applied overview on using R as a researcher. This will cover navigating R, learning how to tidy and explore our data in R, conducting and reporting our analyses in R (APA format ready ðŸ˜‰), and learning tips on how to overcome the intimidating aspects of programming. All of this will be covered within our sHiSS community, where we aim to create a fun and supportive environment as we dip our toes into using programming in research.  

### Workshop aims: 

- Learn to navigate R. 

- Learn how to create a reproducible data tidying workflow. 

- Learn how to conduct your analyses and produce publication ready outputs. 

- Learn where to find materials to continue learning and become more comfortable in using R. 

- To reflect on how these skills can aid our research. 

### Workshop schedule: 

10:00 â€“ 11:00: Meet up, setting up, and navigating R. 

11:00 â€“ 11:15: short break/Q+A. 

11:15 â€“ 12:45: Data tidying workflow guide through (allowing more time as this is the most important stage). 

12:45 - 14:00 : Lunch break 

14:00 â€“ 14:15 : Q+A and consolidation of data tidying workflow 

14:15 â€“ 15:15 : Analysis worksheet walkthrough 

15:15 â€“ 15:30 : short break/Q+A 

15:30 â€“ 16:30 : Create own data tidying/data analysis document (using previous material as reference). Can work with own data, or with a provided data set. (Option to work in pairs?) 

16:30 â€“ 17:00 : reflections on using R, and wrapping up. 

## Workshop Preparation. 

One of the biggest perks of R is that itâ€™s an opensource software. This means it is free to use, and free to download. The opensource aspect of R also means there are plenty of useful packages developed across a variety of fields â€“ so accessible research becomes more available for us all! 

We have two options for using R in the workshop. We can either download and install R and R studio (R is the programming language, R-studio is the software weâ€™ll be using for our coding). We appreciate that even this first step can be intimidating, so we will dedicate part of the workshop for helping out with the setup if needed. 

 
### For running R and R studio on your own device: 

- Download R from the following link: The Comprehensive R Archive Network (imperial.ac.uk).  

- Instal the downloaded file to your computer. 

- Download R studio from the following link https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ . 

- Instal the downloaded file to your computer.  

- Open up R-studio, and youâ€™re ready to go! 

- If you want to play around with coding prior to the workshop, hereâ€™s some useful Online resources: R programming for ABSOLUTE beginners (youtube.com) ; Tom Mock | A Gentle Introduction to Tidy Statistics in R | RStudio (2019) (youtube.com) ; Essential R to learn for statistics and data science in 2024 - YouTube ; An Introduction to R (intro2r.com).
